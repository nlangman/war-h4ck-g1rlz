# Welcome H4ck G1rlz!
## Waring School Software Engineering End Term (Java Programming)

We will be using the following resources:

1. [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
    1. "Code with Me" - so we can collaborate and learn together.
1. [Homebrew for MacOS](https://brew.sh/)
1. Coretto JDK  or Open JDK 16.01 (we will download our JDK through IntelliJ)
1. [Duke University Coursera Course "Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming?specialization=java-programming)
1. Git Hub to save and share our work.
1. Some fun programs I'm building to accelerate your learning. _There's one in this repo waiting for you._
1. A FTC virtual robot emulator to tie it all together (we will pick this together).
